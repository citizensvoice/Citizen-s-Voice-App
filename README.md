# TheVoice by Citizen's Voice

TheVoice is a platform that bridges the communication gap between the Government and the Citizen. It
- Allows verified and authorized legislators, governors, senators to announce a new policy, law, or project to the public.
- Allows citizens to monitor and give government feedback on projects ongoing and completed.
- Offers a platform for citizens to give their own opinions on matters that affect them directly and indirectly.

Here's a demo explaining how the app works. https://youtu.be/04sUan46_KY
